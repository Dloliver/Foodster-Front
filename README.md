### Our Mission
<ol>
Foodster is a sustainability app aimed to spur conversation in reducing the mass food waste produced by many restaurants, grocery stores, and farms. Users can view heavily discounted  unsold goods from establishments around the US, establishments can input and edit their unsold goods, and delete their items as well. By creating a platform where business owners can post their surplus or unsold goods, we can limit the overconsumption of products that ultimately leads to waste as well as the large loss of revenue for these establishments.

### Did You Know...? Some Food For Thought!
***
  * Globally, 1.4 billion tons of food goes to waste every year...
  * However, the US leads the world in annual food waste with a whopping 40 million tons (80 billion pounds)!
  * Prior to COVID-19, 35 million people in America (10 million of those being children) suffered from food insecurity. Those numbers skyrocketed with the financial fallout and number of jobs lost during the pandemic. 
  * Specifically in the US, food is plentiful and costly: this validates many impulse purchases from consumers who buy way more than they can eat because the food itself is undervalued. In turn, that food goes to waste. There is also a small percentage of people who compost. 
  * 40% of food waste comes from restaurants!
 
### How to Combat Overconsumption and Food Waste in Your Community!
***
* KNOW YOUR LABLES! The *Best If Used By* label describes food that is safe to consume but may not taste the same past the given date whereas the *Use By* label applies to highly perishable food items that cause food safety concern over time.
* SCOUR YOUR PANTRY! Donate surplus, non perishable canned goods to your local shelters, women's centers, and food banks. 
* CREATE COMMUNITY! Did that summer garden side-project turn out to be way more successful than you had anticipated? Consider gifting produce to your neighbors and community members! Farmers also appreciate any extra produce they can feed their animals!
* BE INTENTIONAL! Practice intentional shopping methods. It can be easy to get lost in the aisles of grocery stores, stopping every few seconds to marvel at new products. Before doing your shopping have a plan of what you will be cooking or using certain ingredients for and stick to that list!

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
